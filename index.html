            <h2>My Programming Roots</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I learned  HTML and CSS in my high school coding class. We didn't have a teacher who 
               actually coded, but she was in charge of the class. We started with the basics of computers, 
               the history of the Internet, and HTML. I remember I made a website about myself, and included 
               images and styles. I talked about my hobbies and stuff. I was proud of it back then. I also made
               another website teaching you how to make scrambled eggs. I still recall struggling to remember 
               how to link a CSS file to an HTML one. We also had to take a JavaScript test and no ONE knew anything.
               Except me, but only a little bit.

            <h2>Camping Sucks (for me)</h2>
            <p class="otherP">I remember the first time I went camping. I hated it. It was in Blue Springs Ranch. There was
               no internet, there were bugs and I detest having bugs around me (not scared). I had to wave away the 
               flies that were bothering me everytime I was eating. A spider once got in our tent too, so yeah screw
               that. Also, sometimes the nights are too humid so I had trouble falling asleep. As a night person, I was   
               <em>forced</em> to wake up when the sun rose; everything was so bright. Never again.
            </p>
            <h2>Art and Drawing</h2>
            <p class="otherP">
               My oldest and longest hobby is drawing. As a kid, I would always draw Nintendo characters, namely 
               from Super Mario. I created my own fan art of characters and worlds. I then grew out of that liking,
               and started to draw less often, but I still had the skills in me whenever I got the chance. In my high 
               school art class, I did more sketching, figure drawing, and abstract drawing. I even won third place on 
               a contest I didn't even try my best for. I just drew a dog shaking water of its fur with oil pastels. I 
               also started doing digital fan art recently. I hope I finish some of my art I never completed. Seeing others'
               digital art online sometimes inspires me.
